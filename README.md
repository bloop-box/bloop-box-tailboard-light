The board is designed using KiCAD 6 with production and assembly by JLCPCB in mind. All parts are selected to be
available from JLCPCB. At the time of writing as many parts as possible are used from their basic library.

- USB-C Power Input
- 5V only
- Two buttons connected to the Raspberry Pi, per default used for volume control
- Three LEDs 
  - One to show status of power supply
  - Two can be remote-controlled by Raspberry Pi through the Mainboard
